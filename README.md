# wagtail-bootblocks

## Introduction

This project aim to provide a set of basic streamfield blocks base on Bootstrap general components. This allow you to obtain a complete and flexible editor interface for building wagtail websites efficiently through the well used Bootstrap CSS framework. The blocks are split in two types : 

- The _style blocks_, to control the style of each components of your page (content alignement, color, background and manage CSS grid for example)
- The _components blocks_, to display items on your website page (button, text, image, card, container etc..)

The Wagtail streamfield blocks offers few advantages :
    
- The blocks can be reordered easily through the editing interface.
- They can be contain in other blocks for more flexibilty.
- RichTextBlocks offer a really editing advantages.

Finally, the app can be used with the 'wagtail_react_streamfield' app to enhance the editing experience. This wagtail app has nothing to do with real professional package made by the Wagtail community and is far from what has been don today in 'awesome-wagtail', this is just a part of my work that i decided to share ! Nevertheless, I need to mention that lot of Wagtail advanced add-on are oudated since the last Wagtail version.
